\title{Nonlinear Regression Model}

\section{Overview}
  This week I worked on implementing the non-linear model we discussed last time. Let $g$ be whatever group we decide to calculate idleness for (Judge or County) and let $i$ be our current observation, which is a judge-county combination. The non-linear model is:

  \begin{align*}
    \mu_g \text{Days}_i &= \beta_P \text{Plea}_i + \beta_T \text{Trial}_i + \epsilon_i
  \end{align*}

  Where we interpret $\mu_g$ to be the utilization of group $g$. I was having a hard time implementing this, so I asked Walter for advice, and he suggested that I define the function $f(\mu_g,\beta_P,\beta_T) = (\mu_g \text{Days}_i - \beta_P \text{Pleas}_i - \beta_T \text{Trials}_i)^2$ and that I use a standard nonlinear optimizer to minimize it. Walter mentioned that I might have convergence problems since the model is not identified (i.e. multiplying all of the coefficients by any constants would still make the equation hold). Following your advice, I set $\mu_g=1$ for a judge/county that is not the most productive one. I just picked a one randomly, the baseline judge was Judge 41, and the baseline county was Aiken.

\section{Results}
  The model runs and yields estimates of $\mu_g$ between 0 and 1 for all judges and counties, however, the estimates of $\beta_T$ and $\beta_P$ it gives seem unreasonable. The $\beta_T$ estimates seem too low and the $\beta_P$ estimates seem too high.

  \subsection{County Model}
    The results in this subsection correspond to the model: $\mu_c \text{Days}_i = \beta_P \text{Plea}_i + \beta_T \text{Trial}_i + \epsilon_i$. Where $i$ is a judge-county combination and $c$ is a county. The county model yields $\beta_T=1.58$, which would imply that it takes a little over a day and a half to process a trial. The county model also yields $\beta_P=0.02$, which would imply judges can process 50 pleas per day.

    \subsection{Judge Model}
      The results in this subsection correspond to the model: $\mu_j \text{Days}_i = \beta_P \text{Plea}_i + \beta_T \text{Trial}_i + \epsilon_i$. Where $i$ is a judge-county combination and $j$ is a judge. The judge model yields $\beta_T=0.06$. The judge model also yields $\beta_P=0.01$, which would imply judges can process 100 pleas per day.
